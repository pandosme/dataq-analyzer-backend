# Path Structure Description

The DataQ ACAP installed in a camera uses the camera's object detection capabilities to process bounding-box, timestamp, object UID, class, and confidence.
The Path service tracks objects, samples positions when movement is more than 5% of the camera view, and builds a path array of sampled positions.
To manage perspective views, x and y represent the center-of-gravity for the object, typically at the bounding-box middle-bottom, as close to the ground as possible.
The coordinate system is normalized [0,0][1000,1000] regardless of video aspect ratio.

Paths with fewer than 3 sampled positions are discarded and not published.
